# This is a face recognization project based on facenet
[foo]: https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet  (This faceNet project is tensorflow implementation)
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper
["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832). The project also uses ideas from the paper ["A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition"](http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf) as well as the paper ["Deep Face Recognition"](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf) from the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at Oxford.
