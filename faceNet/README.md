## Requirements
1. tensorflow 1.1
2. opencv3.2

## pre-processing
  In this project, I using dilib to align face instead of MTCNN. Because it takes less time to use dilib face align, but the accuarcy don't have much influence

## using model
1. facenet model [20170512-110547](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVZ2RpVDYwWmxoSUk)
2. dilib face detect mode [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8NoJj0) passwordï¼ša6pj
